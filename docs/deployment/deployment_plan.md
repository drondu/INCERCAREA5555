# Deployment Plan Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the steps required to deploy the Sleeping Queens card game application. The deployment plan will ensure that the application is hosted and accessible to users.

## Steps

1. **Set up production environment**
   - Configure the production environment for hosting the application.
   - Ensure that all necessary services (e.g., database, server) are available.

2. **Configure environment variables**
   - Set up environment variables for sensitive information and configuration settings.
   - Ensure that credentials and API keys are not hard-coded in the application.

3. **Set up logging**
   - Implement logging to track application activity and errors in production.
   - Ensure that logs are stored securely and are accessible for monitoring.

4. **Add monitoring tools**
   - Set up monitoring tools to track application performance and health.
   - Monitor key metrics such as response times, error rates, and resource usage.

5. **Deploy to hosting platform**
   - Choose a hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean) for deployment.
   - Follow the platform's guidelines for deploying Node.js applications.

6. **Run database migrations**
   - If applicable, run database migrations to set up the production database schema.
   - Ensure that the database is properly configured for production use.

7. **Test the deployed application**
   - Conduct thorough testing of the deployed application to ensure that it functions as expected.
   - Verify that all features are working correctly in the production environment.

8. **Implement a rollback plan**
   - Develop a rollback plan in case of deployment issues.
   - Ensure that previous versions of the application can be restored quickly if needed.

9. **Document the deployment process**
   - Maintain documentation of the deployment process for future reference.
   - Include details on how to deploy, configure, and troubleshoot the application.

10. **Gather user feedback post-deployment**
    - Collect feedback from users after deployment to identify any issues or areas for improvement.
    - Use feedback to iterate on the application and enhance user experience.
