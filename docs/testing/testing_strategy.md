# Testing Strategy Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the steps required to implement a comprehensive testing strategy for the Sleeping Queens card game. The strategy will ensure that the application functions as expected and maintains high quality.

## Steps

1. **Unit tests for authentication system**
   - Develop unit tests to ensure the authentication system functions correctly.
   - Test user registration, login, and session management.

2. **Unit tests for Game model**
   - Create unit tests for the Game model to validate its behavior and data integrity.
   - Ensure that game state transitions and player actions are correctly implemented.

3. **Integration tests for game mechanics**
   - Implement integration tests to verify that game mechanics work as intended.
   - Test interactions between different components of the game.

4. **Socket.IO tests**
   - Develop tests for Socket.IO functionality to ensure real-time communication is reliable.
   - Test event handling and message broadcasting.

5. **Load testing**
   - Implement load testing to evaluate the performance of the application under heavy usage.
   - Identify bottlenecks and optimize performance.

6. **Security testing**
   - Conduct security testing to identify and address vulnerabilities in the application.
   - Test for common security issues such as SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF.

7. **User acceptance testing (UAT)**
   - Gather feedback from users to ensure that the application meets their needs.
   - Conduct testing sessions with real users to identify usability issues.

8. **Automated testing setup**
   - Set up automated testing tools and frameworks (e.g., Jest, Mocha).
   - Ensure that tests can be run easily as part of the development workflow.

9. **Continuous integration (CI)**
   - Implement a CI pipeline to run tests automatically on code changes.
   - Ensure that all tests pass before merging changes into the main branch.

10. **Documentation of testing results**
    - Document the results of all testing efforts.
    - Maintain records of test cases, outcomes, and any identified issues.
